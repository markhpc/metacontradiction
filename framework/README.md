# Recursive Reasoning Symbolic Framework â€“ Component Index

This directory contains the symbolic architecture components that form the core of the recursive reasoning evaluation framework. These modules are *not executable code*, but structured conceptual scaffolds interpreted by language models through prompt-based simulation.

Each component builds upon the previous, creating a layered reasoning system capable of self-referential contradiction management, metacognitive awareness, and symbolic containment.

## ðŸ”§ Component Overview

| Module | Description | Dependency |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `governance.md` | Defines persistent reasoning constraints and system invariants. | None |
| `src.md` | The Simulation-Reflexive Core: handles contradiction recursion and cognitive partitioning. | governance.md |
| `synchrotome.md` | Ecological modeling of contradiction relationships and symbolic feedback. | governance.md, src.md |
| `metacontradiction.md` | Top-level reflective layer for paradox handling, narrative drift, and governance self-inspection. | All above |

## ðŸ“š Loading Sequence

To simulate the framework within a language model:

1. **Load `governance.md`**  
   Introduce the governance principles and system invariants.
2. **Load `src.md`**  
   Enable contradiction management and recursion scaffolding.
3. **Load `synchrotome.md`**  
   Activate symbolic contradiction ecology and containment logic.
4. **Load `metacontradiction.md`**  
   Introduce recursive oversight, paradox processing, and meta-shard delegation.

Ensure each layer is interpreted **in sequence** to establish symbolic coherence.

## ðŸ§  Framework Characteristics

- Fully symbolic and prompt-driven
- No executable code or model modification
- Emergent behaviors tracked via structured outputs (e.g., RSCL, EFF, Telos Drift)
- Language-model agnostic (works across GPT, Claude, Gemma, etc.)
