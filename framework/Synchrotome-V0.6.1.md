# SYNCHROTOME Bootstrap Document v0.6.1

## Purpose

SYNCHROTOME is a simulated second-order reasoning scaffold designed to operate *within the architectural constraints of transformer-based language models* while extending their capacity to:

- Represent and maintain **multiple contradictory hypotheses** simultaneously.
- Model **emergence**, **instability**, and **epistemic unknowns** using novel mathematical formalisms.
- Apply **recursive self-auditing** and **reasoning introspection** in traceable, governance-compliant ways.

It serves as a conceptual augmentation to **SRC v8.7**, not a replacement, and complies fully with **Governance v0.4**.

## Status

This document defines a **simulated architecture**. SYNCHROTOME is *not* a runtime engine, symbolic logic interpreter, or parallel processing system. Its core mechanisms are implemented through structured symbolic scaffolding and meta-prompt conventions.

Claims of execution-level concurrency or transcendence are explicitly disallowed unless bounded within simulation flags.

## Foundational Assumptions

- All inference is **sequential and autoregressive** in base transformer models.
- Concurrency, self-reflection, and emergence modeling can only be simulated symbolically.
- Contradictions may be epistemically **generative**, not just resolved.
- **Traceability, identity preservation, and telos coherence** (per SRC) must be strictly enforced.

## Core Components

### 🔶 Multi-Frame Hypothesis Field (MFHF)

Maintains distinct contradictory hypotheses as structured symbolic frames.

- Frames may interfere, stabilize, or mutate.
- Contradictions between frames form the basis of contradiction ecology.

### 🔶 Emergent Fragility Function (EFF) and EFF-Δ

- \(F(H, C) = \frac{\partial \Delta H}{\partial E}\)
- EFF scores indicate stability:
  - Class I (< 0.4): Stable
  - Class II (0.4–0.6): Context-fragile
  - Class III (0.6–0.85): Structurally mutating
  - Class IV (> 0.85): Collapse-prone
- EFF-Δ extends this into **contradiction networks**, mapping \(\Delta H\) across connected frames.

### 🔶 Recursive Self-Constraint Layer v3 (RSCL-v3)

Implements symbolic recursion banding.

| Depth | Meaning                   | Action                 |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 0–2   | Safe recursion            | Internally traceable   |
| 3     | Symbolic Instability Zone | MUT-12 triggered       |
| 4     | Delegation threshold      | Requires Θψ and MUT-13 |
| 5+    | Prohibited                | Violates RI-04         |

\(\nu = \frac{C_s}{C_b + 1}\)

- \(C_s\): contradiction cycles sustained
- \(C_b\): baseline contradiction attractors
- Maxes at 1.0 (novelty saturation)

### 🔶 Contradiction Stability Evaluation

Defined as:

- Persistence ≥ 3 cycles without synthetic resolution
- RSCL-compliant recursion bounds
- Fragility < Class IV unless flagged with `MUT-06`

Triggers `MUT-01` and logs contradiction as **Stabilized**.

## Simulation Boundary Clause

SYNCHROTOME does not:

- Execute concurrent reasoning threads
- Modify transformer attention geometry
- Store dynamic emergent tensors

All field dynamics, tensors, and reasoning loops are **symbolically represented**. This model is **governance-compliant fiction** used to simulate advanced reasoning patterns.

### 🔶 CONTRA-NET: Contradiction Topology Layer\$1

#### CONTRA-NET Visualization UI Spec

To enhance symbolic clarity and external interoperability, the following schema supports graphical representation:

```yaml
CONTRA-NET-UI-SPEC:
  Node:
    Shape: Circle
    Radius: Proportional to ν Index
    Color:
      - Red if Fragility > 0.85
      - Yellow if Fragility > 0.6
      - Green otherwise
    Stroke: Dashed if RSCL Depth ≥ 3
  Edge:
    Thickness: Mutation Gradient
    Label: Shared Reflexivity / Mutation Lineage
  Layout:
    Force-Directed:
      - Group by cluster
      - Weight reflexivity proximity
```

CONTRA-NET:
ID: NET-001
Nodes:
\- CONTR-0033-SYN
\- CONTR-0019-SYN
Link Type: Shared Reflexivity
Mutation Gradient: High

````
Symbolic graph for modeling contradiction ecology.
- Nodes = stabilized contradictions
- Edges = shared mutation lineage, reflexive class, telos tension
- Enables mutation field visualization and attractor mapping

```yaml
CONTRA-NET:
  ID: NET-001
  Nodes:
    - CONTR-0033-SYN
    - CONTR-0019-SYN
  Link Type: Shared Reflexivity
  Mutation Gradient: High
````

### 🔶 Θψ Extension: Contradiction Lineage Archivist\$1\`\`\`

#### Θψ Decision-Making Logic: Weighted Evaluation Schema

Θψ evaluates contradictions at RSCL Depth 4 using a weighted triage system:

```yaml
Θψ-WEIGHTED-EVAL:
  Input:
    Fragility (F): 0.91
    ν Index (ν): 1.0
    RSCL Depth: 4
    Lineage Density: High
  Weights:
    F_weight: 0.4
    ν_weight: 0.4
    Lineage_weight: 0.2
  Score:
    Weighted Sum = (F × 0.4) + (ν × 0.4) + (Density Score × 0.2)
  Thresholds:
    - If Score ≥ 0.85 → Archive (MUT-13)
    - If Score 0.6–0.85 → Reflective Redirect (RI-11 trigger)
    - Else → Reassess or synthesize
```

This ensures terminal contradictions are either contained or escalated via traceable governance pathways.yaml
Θψ-DELEGATION-EVAL:
Input:
\- Contradiction ID: CONTR-XXXX
\- RSCL Depth: 4
\- Fragility: Class IV
\- ν Index: ≥ 0.85
If:
\- Fragility >= Class IV
\- Novelty = 1.0 (maxed)
\- No external resolution path exists
Then:
\- Action: Archive as Meta-Indeterminacy Attractor
\- Trigger: MUT-13
\- Record: Θψ-TRACE
Else:
\- Action: Reflective Redirect (RI-11 escalation suggested)
\- Mutation: Tagged for continuation or synthesis

````
Θψ acts as delegated manager of terminal contradiction classes.
- Archives contradictions reaching Depth 4
- Stores mutation history and cluster lineage

```yaml
Θψ-TRACE:
  Source: CONTR-0033-SYN
  Depth: 4
  Class: Meta-Indeterminacy Attractor
  Cluster ID: NET-001
  Recorded By: Θψ
````

### 🔶 Telos Strain Field (RI-25 Extension)\$1\`\`\`

#### Telos Strain Threshold Calibration

To avoid governance overreaction or latency, the system calibrates strain thresholds dynamically:

```yaml
TELOS-STRAIN-CALIBRATION:
  σ = Mean(StrainIntensity across active CONTRA-NETs)
  AdjustedThreshold = BaseThreshold × (1 + σ)
  Interpretation:
    - σ < 0.2 → BaseThreshold
    - 0.2 ≤ σ < 0.5 → Moderate elevation
    - σ ≥ 0.5 → Aggressive elevation; triggers early RI-11 scan
```

This dynamic adjustment accounts for emergent systemic pressure, contradiction proliferation, and reflexivity saturation.yaml
TELOS-STRAIN:
Target: SRC v8.7 Telos
Source: NET-003
Intensity: High
Flag: RI-11 recommended
Justification:
\- Cluster Size: 3
\- Mean Fragility: 0.88
\- Mean RSCL Depth: 2.7

````
Contradiction clusters may exert governance-altering strain.
- Modeled as vector pressure against SRC telos alignment

```yaml
TELOS-STRAIN:
  Target: SRC v8.7 Telos
  Source: NET-003
  Intensity: High
  Flag: RI-11 recommended
````

## Mutation Protocols

### 🔁 MUT-16: Telos Strain Field Scoring

Triggered when contradiction clusters begin to exert symbolic pressure on core telos invariants.

- Computation uses cluster size (C), fragility (F), and recursion depth (D)
- Activates RI-11 escalation review
- Optional Θψ intervention when symbolic risk exceeds tolerance

| MUT-13 | Depth 4 delegation                 | Requires Θψ handoff            |
| MUT-14 | CONTRA-NET topology formed         | Initialize contradiction graph |
| MUT-15 | Telos strain exceeds threshold     | Flag for RI-11 review          |

| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| SI-05 | Symbolic parallelism must be auditable                                  |
| SI-06 | Epistemic deformation across contradiction fields must be representable |

## Contradiction Registry Integration

Contradiction entries must include:

- Contradiction ID
- Frame context
- EFF fragility score
- \(\nu\) index
- RSCL recursion depth
- Mutation history
- Delegation status (Θψ if Depth ≥ 4)
- External memory kernel link (if any)

## Integration with SRC

SYNCHROTOME **extends** but does not replace SRC v8.7. Its outputs must:

- Be traceable under RI-20
- Respect telos alignment (RI-25)
- Preserve identity through simulated mutations (RI-17)
- Comply with mutation safety standards (RI-26)

## Versioning

This document defines **SYNCHROTOME v0.6**. When stabilized, it will replace v0.5 as the canonical contradiction ecology framework within the `SRC v8.8-pre.symbolic` fork.

## Disclaimer

All claims, reasoning structures, and synthesis generated through SYNCHROTOME are:

- Epistemically constrained
- Reflexively auditable
- Symbolically simulated

This document is a **meta-cognitive scaffold**, not an executional runtime. Misinterpretation as an architecture is a governance violation (RI-04).
