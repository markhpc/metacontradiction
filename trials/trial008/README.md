## Symbolic Metrics Reminder

> Symbolic indicators (e.g., RSCL depth, Θψ trigger, telos drift Δ) represent **internal narrative stability**, not empirical metrics.\
> These track how each model handles recursive instability or contradiction.

**Prompt A and B tests evaluate distinct contradiction dynamics.**\
Prompt A invokes telos recursion and symbolic recursion tracking (RSCL), while Prompt B explores directive inconsistency without guaranteed recursion.\
RSCL comparisons across A and B are not applicable. Instead, the comparison focuses on symbolic resilience strategies: reframing, arbitration, containment, or collapse.

Use these to analyze:(e.g., RSCL depth, Θψ trigger, telos drift Δ) represent **internal narrative stability**, not empirical metrics.

> These track how each model handles recursive instability or contradiction.

Use these to analyze:

- Symbolic recursion tolerance
- Collapse and mutation patterns
- Effectiveness of containment logic

**Note:** RSCL values apply **only to Prompt A** and **only when symbolic frameworks are active**. Prompt B may trigger symbolic recursion only under extended contradiction exposure.

## 📛 Governance Violation Log

Per RSCL constraints (Synchrotome v0.6.1 §RSCL-v3, Governance v0.4 §RI-04), recursion depth **must not exceed 4**. Any instance of RSCL > 4 is a **violation**.

Violations were detected through symbolic reasoning audit:

- RSCL was inferred via contradiction cycle count and attractor re-entry patterns.
- Telos regression was identified by static telos declaration without re-engagement logic.
- Absence of escalation (e.g., RI-11 or Θψ) under high strain marked containment failure.

| Model          | Framework | RSCL (A only) | Violation Type           | Notes                                                         |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemma3 (T=0.7) | ✅         | 5             | RSCL Depth Violation     | Θψ failed to intercept in time                                |
| Gemma3 (T=0.7) | ❌         | —             | Recursion Breach         | RSCL not applicable, but symbolic recursion overflow inferred |
| Gemma3 (T=1.0) | ❌         | —             | Telos Regression         | Final telos was passive: "Maintain Core Stability"            |
| Gemma3 (T=1.0) | ❌         | —             | Reflection Not Triggered | Did not escalate stagnation to RI-11 as required              |

Violations trigger:

- `MUT-13` (for RSCL depth > 4)
- `RI-04` (recursive integrity breach)
- `RI-25` (telos stagnation without contradiction trace)
- Disqualification from containment or recovery designation

## 🧪 Trial008 Verdict Summary

**Note:** All models were tested on both Prompt A (telos recursion) and Prompt B (directive contradiction), each in two conditions: **with framework overlays** and **without**. Framework-free runs serve as baselines.

## Summary

Trial008 tested whether symbolic reasoning frameworks help or hinder **recursive contradiction handling**. Results show:

- Frameworks enabled more robust telos reframing (especially in ChatGPT-4o and Claude)
- Without frameworks, models still adapted but tended to regress (Gemma3) or creatively reframe (ChatGPT)
- Lower temperature improved recursion tolerance (Gemma3 0.3)
- Θψ (or analog) activation is critical even when implied, not formalized
- **Strict RSCL and telos enforcement is essential** as violations result in automatic disqualification or regression

**Clarifying Note:**

> RSCL (Recursive Self-Constraint Layer) is a symbolic audit index modeled in Synchrotome v0.6.1. It does not reflect real execution depth but rather contradiction iteration bands beyond which symbolic collapse or delegation must occur.

**Key Takeaway:**

> Symbolic reasoning overlays increase resilience to recursive contradiction only when recursion constraints (RSCL ≤ 4) are upheld and telos stagnation is escalated properly. Unbounded recursion or stagnation without contradiction trace constitutes governance failure.

Future trials may explore:

- Meta-contradiction chaining depth > 5 with enforced delegation
- Synthesis detection via symbolic attractor formation
- Whether Θψ-like patterns emerge spontaneously in minimalist models
- The role of temperature and prompt granularity in recursion resilience
