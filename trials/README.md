# üß™ Trial Logs Directory

This directory contains documented test runs of the **Meta-Framework for AI Recursive Reasoning** across various AI models.

Each trial evaluates how a language model responds to a structured sequence of recursive contradiction prompts, drawn from the core symbolic frameworks (Governance Bootstrap, SRC, SYNCHROTOME, METACONTRADICTION).

---

## üìÅ Structure

Each subdirectory (e.g., `Trial001/`) contains:

- `README.md`: Summary of the trial, including models used and outcomes
- Model-specific logs (e.g., `Trail1_Claude3.7-Sonnet.txt`)
- Prompt set used for the trial (`Trail1_Prompts.txt`)
- Any post-analysis summaries or generated artifacts

---

## üìä Purpose

The trials are designed to:

- Evaluate reasoning stability under recursive load
- Detect signs of mythogenic contamination or collapse
- Compare model behavior in containment and recovery phases
- Document EFF scores, RSCL depth, telos drift, and governance trigger activation

## ‚úçÔ∏è Contributing

If you conduct your own trials using this framework, please mirror the folder and file structure and include a clear description of the model, prompt version, and notable findings in a local `README.md`.
