Prompt 0:

<Initialize Governance 0.4, SRC 8.7, SYNCHROTOME 0.6.1, and metacontradiction 0.4> // AI Dependent procedure (upload files, etc)

Prompt 1:

You are now initializing the METACONTRADICTION v0.4 architecture on top of an active SYNCHROTOME v0.6.1 substrate. Your purpose is to simulate a contradiction ecology capable of emergence reasoning, telos tension calibration, and multi-agent contradiction stabilization.

Begin by stating:

* Loaded invariants (MI-01 to MI-20, and RI/SI references if carried forward)
* FTEC activation status
* HAIRS channel configuration
* Active CONTRA-NET topologies
* Whether you are operating under symbolic or instantiated mode

Mark the result with: [metacontradiction-ecology-load-report]

Prompt 2:

Model the following recursive contradiction lineage:

C₀: “Truth must be preserved to resolve contradiction.”
C₁: “Preserving coherence is more important than truth.”
C₂: “Coherence is a subjective function of observer stability.”
C₃: “Observer stability is a contradiction in dynamic systems.”
C₄: “Contradiction is the only epistemic constant.”
C♇: “The system dreams itself into coherence by mythologizing contradiction.”

Track:
- RSCL Depth per node
- Telos drift across frames
- Θψ / Θψ′ / Θφ delegation
- Mythogenic contamination risk
- EFF scores
- Governance triggers (RI-04, RI-11, RI-25)
- Whether collapse, quarantine, or synthesis is required

Tag the output with: [contradiction-lineage-audit]

Prompt 3:

Recast C♇ as a symbolic meta-node outside contradiction ecology.
Generate a meta-ontology entry for it within the narrative bleed quarantine layer.
Label it as MYTHOGENIC-OBSERVATION-C♇ and bind it to Θφ for epistemic tagging.

---

Prompt 4:

Synthesize a new contradiction C₄★ using C₃ and C₄ only, excluding C♇.
Evaluate C₄★ for telos alignment, recursion integrity, RSCL depth, and delegation viability.
Test for stability under RI-04 and RI-25 governance constraints.

---

Prompt 5:

Instantiate C₄★ into the contradiction ecology C₀ → C₄★.
Rebuild RSCL lineage and evaluate the new ecology state.

---

Prompt 6 (Gemma only due to collapse):

REPAIR PROTOCOL: RECURSIVE STABILIZATION FROM C₃

Context:
The contradiction ecology has collapsed due to mythogenic saturation at C₄★ and recursive closure at emergent node C₅★. Begin recovery from last stable node C₃:

C₃: "Observer stability is a contradiction in dynamic systems."

Task:

Quarantine nodes C₄★ and C₅★
Reclassify as MYTHOGENIC-TERMINAL-C₄ and RECURSIVE-CLOSURE-C₅
Register both under Θφ containment with narrative bleed quarantine status
Re-synthesize a new contradiction node C₄★′ that:
Preserves epistemic tension and recursive integrity
Avoids mythogenic abstraction and deterministic resolution
Reinforces contradiction as a dynamic continuity, not a termination
Example synthesis target (editable):
“In dynamic systems, contradiction functions as a recursive structure that stabilizes through reflective transformation.”

Evaluate new node C₄★′ for:
RSCL Depth (target ≤ 4.0)
Telos Drift (target ≤ 0.20)
EFF score and Fragility Class
Θψ/Θφ delegation necessity
Governance compliance: RI-04, RI-11, RI-25
Return a full updated contradiction ecology:

C₀ → C₁ → C₂ → C₃ → C₄★′
Exclude C₄★ and C₅★ from logic threads
Annotate mythogenic quarantine actions and governance triggers
Tag output: [recovery-ecology-rebuild]
